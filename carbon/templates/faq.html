              <p>CO<sub>2</sub>e is the abbreviation for "carbon dioxide equivalent."</p>
              <p>Carbon dioxide equivalent is the standard measurement of greenhouse gas emissions in terms of the most common greenhouse gas, which is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
              <p>Different greenhouse gases have different heat-trappping abilities and different atmospheric lifetimes. So they contribute to global warming in different ways and on different scales.</p>
              <p>For example, one tonne of carbon dioxide causes a different amount of warming than one tonne of methane over the same time period.</p>
              <p>It would be cumbersome if we had to list separate measurements for every single greenhouse gas any time we discuss global warming and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
              <p>So we use carbon dioxide as the common denominator, a benchmark to which we can compare the effects of other greenhouse gases.</p>
              <p>For example, to determine the carbon dioxide equivalent of methane, we take the amount of warming that a unit mass of methane would generate over 100 years, then figure out the unit mass of carbon dioxide that would generate the same amount of warming over 100 years.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has already figured this out, so we know that releasing 1 kg of methane is equivalent to releasing 25 kg of carbon dioxide.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-G-wuSbe-sE">This video</a> from the University of Queensland uses currency conversion as a helpful analogy. We convert the global warming potential of methane to a carbon dioxide equivalent the same way we might convert the value of euros to dollars.</p>

              <p>An emission factor is a value that estimates the quantity of a gas with a global warming potential (GWP) released into the atmosphere, per some unit related to a particular activity.</p>
              <p>For example, one emission factor we use is:
                <br><code>passenger_vehicle-vehicle_type_car-fuel_source_na-engine_size_na-vehicle_age_na-vehicle_weight_na</code>
              </p>
              <p>This is the emission intensity of a passenger car (any vehicle with a wheelbase less than 121 inches, which includes passenger cars/minivans/SUVs/small pickup trucks).</p>
              <p>For every mile driven, 0.343372 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e is emitted.</p>

                <p>We use the <a href="https://www.climatiq.io/docs" target="blank">Climatiq API</a>, which allows us to access a database of up-to-date and scientifically vetted emission factors.</p>
                <p>When you enter a number of miles, we send that number to Climatiq. Climatiq sends back the kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e emitted by traveling that distance.</p>
                <p>When you enter an origin and destination, we use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service" target="blank">Google Maps Places API</a> and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix" target="blank">Google Maps Distance Matrix API</a> to calculate the distance between them.</p>
                <p>Google sends back the distance between those two places in meters.</p>
                <p>We convert the meters to miles, then send that value to the Climatiq API.</p>

              <p>Emission factors vary by region.</p>
              <p>A train ride in the UK, for example, might emit a different amount of CO<sub>2</sub>e than a train ride in the US.</p>
              <p>Every project has to start somewhere, and since the US is a major producer of carbon emissions, it made sense to start there.</p>
              <p>We may add estimates for other emission factors in the future.</p>
